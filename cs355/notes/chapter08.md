#Development Testing
####Unit Testing
#####Strategies
- partition testing: identify groups of input ("equivalence classes") that should be processed by the method in the same way test with at least one input from each group.
  - if tests are developed without looking at code, this is "black box" testing
  - "white box" testing if code is already written

- Guideline-based: test commonly neglected cases according to the programming constructs used
