# Requirements Engineering
_The process of establishing the services that the client requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed._

- Can be high level, or low level

#### Types of Requirements
- User Req's
    - Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for the customer
- System Req's
    - A structured doc setting out detailed descriptions of the system's functions, services and operational constraints.
    

#### Review Checks
- Verifiability: realistically testable?
- Comprehensibility: properly understood
- Traceability: where did it origin from?
- Adaptability: can it be modified?

#### Requirements management
_Process of anaging changing requirements during the requirements engineering process and system development_
- Deciding if a requirements change should be accepted
  - Problem analysis and change specification: check that proposal is valid.
  - Change analysis and costing: 
  - Change Implementation:
