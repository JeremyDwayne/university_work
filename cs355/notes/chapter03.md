# Agile Development
_incremental approach that emphasize code over design and documentation to deliver software rapidly_

## Principles of Agile Methods
- Customer Involvement: Clients are closely involved throughout the dev process. Identify new requirements and evaluate iterations of the system
- Incremental Delivery: Software is delivered incrementally and adjusted as new requirements are made clear
- People not Process: The skills of the dev team are recognized and utilized.
- Embrace Change: Expect specs to change so design the system to be adjustable
- Maintain Simplicity: Strive to keep both the software system and the development process simple.

- Preferred in small to medium development teams and products

#### Problems with Agile
- difficult to keep clients interested throughout the dev process
- Team members may be unsuited for specific tasks
- Dev teams not only have to focus on development, but also support maintenance at the same time

#### Technical, human, organizational issues
- Most projects include elements of both plan driven, and agile processes.
    - Detailed Specs & Documentation? Plan Driven
    - Incremental Delivery and rapid feedback? Agile
    - How large is the software system? Small: Agile, Large: Planned
    - Type of system? Lots of analysis before implementation: plan driven
    - Expected lifetime? Long: more design documentation - planned
    - What technologies are available to the development team? Agile methods rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design
    - How organized is the team? Design docs keep everyone on the same page.
    - Cultural or organizational issues? How does the team normally develop software.
    - How good are the designers and programmers on the team? newer programmers may find planned processes easier to keep track of.
    - External Regulation? If it needs to be approved by an external regulator, ie FAA for an aircraft software: detailed documentation will be required - planned

#### Extreme Programming (XP)
- Perhaps the best known and most widely used
- takes the "extreme approach" to iterative development
    - new versions may be built several times per day
    - deliveries every two weeks
    - all tests must be run successfully before a build will be accepted
- Incremental Dev: small, frequent system releases
- Customer involvement: full-time client engagement
- People not process: pair programming, collective ownership and shorter working hours.
- Change supported through regular releases
- Constant refactoring

##### Practices
- Incremental Planning: User Stories
- Small Releases: frequent releases that all a little more functionality than the previous
- Simple Design: Enough design is carried out to meet current req's and no more
- Test Driven Development: write the tests for the code to meet requirements before you write the actual code
- Refactoring: Refactor code continuously as you develop
- Pair Programming: multiple devs work on the same code at the same time (code review and knowledge sharing)
- Collective Ownership: Devs work on all areas of the system, no islands of expertise.
- Continuous integration: as soon as a new feature is complete its added to the whole system
- Sustainable pace: lower hours worked, higher productivity and code quality instead of overtime and burnout
- On-site customer: a main representative for the client will be available to the dev team to review the system requirements and iterations
