#### Thoughts and Recommendations

Overall, I did most of the work. It's difficult to share responsibilities when you're one of two people in the group with a working rails installation, and when you're the only one who knows the framework. Joe got by alright in the end, but still most of his was html based, which I had to convert to rails -- nothing wrong with that.

Unfortunately, I have to discourage you from using rails in future SE1 classes. Its a great framework, but students are unwilling to learn a new language if its not taught in class or required individual work. More importantly the hardware limitations are a barrier that most couldn't care enough to overcome. I recommend choosing a framework yourself, and projects that are useful and allow teaching each topic in depth.
